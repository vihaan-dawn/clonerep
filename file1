CipherCloud is committed to building trust in the cloud. Our revolutionary cloud encryption gateway technology is enabling organizations worldwide to enjoy the benefits of the cloud that otherwise wouldn't be able to due to concerns about data security, privacy, residency, and regulatory compliance.
Our company was founded in 2010 by security visionary Pravin Kothari, who has started two other successful security companies, including ArcSight, which was sold to Hewlett Packard for $1.6 billion. Pravin recognized that while the cloud was experiencing explosive national drug code 0019-9891-11 growth, the technologies that addressed the new security threats associated with this new model had not kept pace. Pravin saw an opportunity to protect sensitive enterprise data across multiple clouds through a revolutionary new approach—the cloud encryption gateway. This technology allows organizations to protect their data in the cloud without sacrificing application functionality, the user experience, or performance , and without making any changes to the cloud application. 
CipherCloud’s vision, along with one of the most well-respected management teams in cloud security, has attracted investment from premier venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz (Facebook, Twitter, Groupon, Skype, and Zynga), Index Ventures, and T-Venture, the VC investment arm of Deutsche Telekom.
CipherCloud has experienced exceptional growth and success, and already has over 100 employees and marquee customers in US, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. Our company and our ground-breaking innovation in format and operation-preserving encryption and tokenization technology have been recognized for their innovation by industry thought leaders with over a dozen awards including Gartner’s Cool Vendor in Cloud Security. We’ve delivered products for major cloud services such as Salesforce, Google Apps, Amazon Cloud, and Office 365, and we’re really just getting started.
